# shellaudio â€“ AthenaHacks 2018

Shell was built in a weekend as a chance for us to practice Java and learn Android development. A secondary goal of the project was to design an app for musicans that is both beautiful and functional (which is a rarity these days), so the app was created with UX and UI ideas in mind. 

The app was meant to help musicians practice ear training, so it generates two notes within an octave of each other and allows the user to input what interval they think it is. A counter in the corner counts how many consecutive intervals have been identified correctly.
